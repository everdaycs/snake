/**
 * Provides the classes necessary for managing controllers in the Snake Game application.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code com.example.cyc_snake.controllers} package is central to the Snake Game application, housing
 * controllers responsible for handling various views and user interactions. These controllers play a crucial
 * role in managing the game logic, processing user inputs, and facilitating interactions between the underlying
 * models and views. Each controller class is designed to handle specific aspects of the game, ensuring a modular
 * and organized approach to application architecture.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Controller Classes:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GameController}: Manages the game view and its associated functionality.</li>
 *   <li>{@code NewPlayerController}: Handles the new player registration and input processing.</li>
 *   <li>{@code LeaderboardController}: Controls the leaderboard view and player rankings.</li>
 *   <li>{@code InitializingViewController}: Manages the initialization and main menu views.</li>
 *   <li>{@code HistoryPlayerViewController}: Handles the history player view and player data.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GameViewController}: Controls the main game view and user interactions during gameplay.</li>
 *   <li>{@code EndGameViewController}: Manages the end game view and actions after the game concludes.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GameinforController}: Manages the game information view and actions of back to initializing view</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Handling user interactions and inputs in different views of the Snake Game application.</li>
 *   <li>Managing the flow of the game, from initialization to gameplay and handling end game scenarios.</li>
 *   <li>Facilitating communication between models and views through event handling and data updates.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Package Structure:</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package follows a structured approach, with each controller class designed for a specific view or
 * aspect of the game. This organization enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier
 * to extend or modify the application in the future.
