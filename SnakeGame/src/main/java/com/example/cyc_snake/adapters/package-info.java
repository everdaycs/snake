/**
 * Provides the classes necessary for managing adapters in the Snake Game application.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code com.example.cyc_snake.adapters} package is essential to the Snake Game application, housing
 * adapters responsible for connecting controllers with the main application components. These adapters play
 * a crucial role in initializing controllers and establishing connections between different parts of the
 * application. Each adapter class is designed to adapt a specific controller and ensure smooth communication
 * between the controllers, the state manager, and the main application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Adapter Classes:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GameControllerAdapter}: Adapts the GameController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code NewPlayerViewAdapter}: Adapts the NewPlayerController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code LeaderboardViewAdapter}: Adapts the LeaderboardController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code InitializingViewAdapter}: Adapts the InitializingViewController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code HistoryPlayerViewAdapter}: Adapts the HistoryPlayerViewController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GameViewAdapter}: Adapts the GameViewController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code EndGameViewAdapter}: Adapts the EndGameViewController for integration with the main components.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GameInfoViewAdapter}: Adapts the GameInfoController for integration with the main components.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Initializing controllers and establishing connections with the main application components.</li>
 *   <li>Ensuring smooth communication between controllers, the state manager, and the main application.</li>
 *   <li>Facilitating the integration of controllers into the overall application architecture.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Package Structure:</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package follows a structured approach, with each adapter class designed for a specific controller.
 * This organization enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to extend or modify
 * the application in the future.
