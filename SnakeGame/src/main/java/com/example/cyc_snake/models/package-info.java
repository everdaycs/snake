/**
 * Contains classes representing the core models for the Snake Game application.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code com.example.cyc_snake.models} package is a crucial component of the Snake Game
 * application. It encapsulates various classes that serve as models, representing essential
 * entities and structures required for the game's functionality.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Models:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GameModel}: The {@code GameModel} class is the heart of the game, representing
 *       the state of the gameplay. It includes information about the snake, apple, and game board.
 *       This model is responsible for updating the game state during active gameplay.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SpeedUpApple}: The {@code SpeedUpApple} class represents an apple that increases the
 *       speed of the snake when consumed. It is part of the game's power-up system, contributing to
 *       the variety of interactions within the game.</li>
 *   <li>{@code GameOverApple}: The {@code GameOverApple} class represents an apple that triggers
 *       the end of the game when consumed. It serves as a game-ending condition, providing a
 *       challenge for the players.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SpeedDownApple}: The {@code SpeedDownApple} class represents an apple that decreases
 *       the speed of the snake when consumed. It introduces a dynamic element to the game, requiring
 *       players to adapt to changing conditions.</li>
 *   <li>{@code ScoreBoostApple}: The {@code ScoreBoostApple} class represents an apple that boosts
 *       the player's score when consumed. It enhances the scoring mechanics, rewarding players for
 *       strategic decisions during gameplay.</li>
 *   <li>(Other model classes): The package may include additional model classes representing
 *       different aspects of the game. For example, classes for player information, high scores,
 *       or any other critical game entities.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defining classes that serve as models for various game entities and structures.</li>
 *   <li>Encapsulating game logic and behavior within the model classes to maintain a clean and
 *       organized architecture.</li>
 *   <li>Providing a structured approach to managing and accessing game data.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Package Structure:</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package structure includes multiple model classes, each dedicated to representing a specific
 * aspect of the game. The models collectively contribute to the overall functionality and dynamics
 * of the Snake Game application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Example Usage:</h2>
 * <p>
 * Below is an example snippet showcasing how the {@code GameModel} class can be utilized within the
 * game application:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * GameModel gameModel = new GameModel();
 * gameModel.initializeGame();
 * gameModel.update(); // Perform game state updates
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2023-12-09
